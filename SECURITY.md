# Security Policy

Maintainer Firewall helps route security-sensitive reports, but it is not a secret scanner, vulnerability scanner, or replacement for human security review.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a vulnerability in this project. Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting if it is enabled, or contact the maintainers through the security contact listed by the repository owner.

If you believe Maintainer Firewall exposed or mishandled a credential-like value, include:

- The action version or commit SHA
- The workflow event that triggered the run
- Whether `ai.enabled` was true
- A redacted example of the report body or PR body

Do not include live tokens, private keys, or unreleased exploit details in public reports.

## Security Design Notes

- The action never checks out pull request code.
- For pull requests, configuration and guidance are loaded from the base ref.
- Possible credential findings intentionally do not repeat the matched value.
- If a possible credential is detected, AI analysis is skipped for that issue or pull request.
- AI analysis is optional and disabled by default.
- When AI analysis is enabled, only the issue or PR metadata, changed file list, and configured repository guidance are sent to the model.
