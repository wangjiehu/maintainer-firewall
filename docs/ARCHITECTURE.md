# Architecture

Maintainer Firewall is built as a GitHub JavaScript Action with a small deterministic core and an optional AI layer.

## Flow

1. Load configuration from the base ref and collect load-shape diagnostics.
2. Build an issue or pull request subject from the GitHub event.
3. Apply ignore rules.
4. Run deterministic rules.
5. Skip AI analysis if a possible secret is detected.
6. Load repository guidance and CODEOWNERS hints when needed.
7. Run optional AI analysis with timeout, input truncation, output normalization, and redaction.
8. Apply exact finding-ID policy for suppression and severity overrides.
9. Create a review summary with outcome, score, next steps, labels, and routing hints.
10. Redact report-facing finding and summary fields.
11. Set action outputs and optionally emit GitHub Actions annotations for findings.
12. Compose a maintainer-only setup summary for the Actions step summary.
13. Write logs, step summary, optional JSON report with diagnostics, labels, and comment.

## Design Principles

- Deterministic checks run first and work without network calls beyond GitHub.
- AI analysis is advisory, optional, and disabled by default.
- Issue and pull request text are treated as untrusted input.
- Possible credentials are not repeated in findings or structured reports.
- The action does not check out pull request code.
- Label and comment writes are best-effort so triage does not fail because of permission differences.
- Pull request file listing and existing report comment lookup degrade to warnings so body/title triage can continue.
- Native workflow annotations are opt-in to keep the default experience low-noise.
- The setup summary is kept out of issue and pull request comments so contributor-facing reports stay focused.
- Finding policy uses exact IDs to avoid broad accidental suppression.
- Possible credential findings remain protected and cannot be suppressed or downgraded.
- Configuration diagnostics are redacted before being exposed through outputs, step summaries, or JSON reports.

## Main Modules

- `src/index.ts`: action entry point and orchestration.
- `src/annotations.ts`: optional GitHub Actions annotation emission.
- `src/rules.ts`: deterministic issue and pull request findings.
- `src/review.ts`: outcome, score, passed checks, next steps, and routing model.
- `src/comment.ts`: Markdown report rendering and comment policy.
- `src/redaction.ts`: shared redaction helpers for subjects, findings, summaries, comments, and JSON reports.
- `src/ai.ts`: optional OpenAI Responses API integration.
- `src/guidance.ts`: repository guidance loading.
- `src/codeowners.ts`: best-effort CODEOWNERS routing hints.
- `src/finding-policy.ts`: exact finding-ID suppression and severity overrides.
- `src/report.ts`: structured JSON report generation.
- `src/labels.ts`: desired and stale managed label calculation.
- `src/setup-summary.ts`: maintainer-facing setup state for Actions step summaries.
